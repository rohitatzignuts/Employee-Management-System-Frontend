# EMS

This is the backend implementation for the Employee Management System project.

### Prerequisites
You need the backend running for this to work. Clone the backend from [this repository](https://github.com/rohitatzignuts/Employee-Management-System-Backend).

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the backend repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Configure your environment variables.
4. Run the backend server.

### Backend Features
- Manages employees, companies, jobs and roles.
- Provides APIs for CRUD operations on employees, jobs, and job applicants.
- Supports authentication and authorization for different user roles.
- Uses Laravel as the backend framework.

### Technologies Used
- Laravel
- MySQL
- PHP
- RESTful APIs

### Note
Ensure that the frontend is configured to communicate with the backend APIs for full functionality.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates.

However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can run `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

```sh
npm install
